# TO DO LIST

This document will fill itself with well define tasks as we move on. For now, it is not very specific. 
For now, if you have ideas on what specifically can be done, please, fill out this document. If you don't but want to participate, please join us in the Telegram groups (links in the README.md file) and open the dialogue. 

## Backend

##### Create a structure for the database. 

The structure needs to be flexible enough to manage effectively the data. The data is regrouped in the DATA_DB.md file. 

##### Create Node scripts that will read blockchains blocks

For each blockchain, we need a script that will extract all the data from the X blocks produced during the timelapse between two script iterations. 

##### Create Node scripts that will webites and APIs

- Read CoinMarketCap (CMC) public API and get all the information price, supply, 24% change, ...
- Read CMC individual blockchain pages and extract more info (website and block explorer URL, twitter, active markets, ...)



## Frontend

Start by having a look in the docs/ directory, you'll find there the demo made by the SCORUM team. This is where it all begins.
Feel free to add more specific tasks in this section as you go. 
A Telegram group has been made to communicate about this section. (https://t.me/joinchat/BdGiiBFbVBOwBkvl4GbgpA)

(I'm currently learning to evolve the backend part so this section won't evolve with me at the moment.)
