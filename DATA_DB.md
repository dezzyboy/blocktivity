# Data
#

*In this document, I regroup all the information that I want to collect and store in a database. 
Not everything will be used in the homepage. This data will serve to develop different parts (or sections) in Blocktivity. I believe that by providing a large collection of data, I will lay down a fertile ground upon which passionate people will develop their own table, charts, analysis... and make it available in the website.
I will collect this information mainly by reading blockchain blocks every XX minuts but also reading other websites and APIs.*
