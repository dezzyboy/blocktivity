# BLOCK'TIVITY 

www.blocktivity.info

### Introduction

Blocktivity has started by showing some important data concerning the blockchain field. It should evolve and give more valuable information. I'm open sourcing and bringing people on board because I want to create an environment where blockchain passionates can gather and add relevant information. There is tons of analysis, data and charts that can be done on blockchains and nobody seems to care doing it. 

Blocktivity homepage was intended to be "shocking" by comparing activity to market cap with few numbers and few charts. I want to keep it that way. It is a great introduction saying "hey, there is much more than the market cap!". This is my only firm wish. My goal is to create and incentive to create other "sections" with a focus other kind of data and analysis. 

As for the economic aspect, I'm confident that few and discrete advertisement banners could provide some money for the server cost and pay bounties for some extra work that the community won't enjoy doing. People that inject time in a specific section could be able to monetize their effort by getting money from the advertising from their specific section. That should incentivise even more passion into this endeavour.  We are still at the dawn of the blockchain revolution my dear passionate friends, let's wax our boards, a big wave is coming ... 

### Where are we now ?

Right now Blocktivity is made with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. It has been coded from start to end with my very limited coding skills. Instead of working on a bike and trying to transform it into a poorly functional car, I would suggest we start from scratch and make a rocket!

After a long discussion on the matter, the conclusion is that Node.js / JavaScript will be used at the front and backend, MySQL or MongoDB as a database and Express as a framework. At least to kickstart the project. 
 
The Scorum (scorumcoins.com) team had the kindness to work on a demo and I'm very impressed by what they have done. You'll find the images and video of this demo in the docs/ directory. 

I'm creating the database structure. 
I'm also learning Express, JS, NODE to write the first scripts that will read the blockchain blocks, websites and APIs to fill the database. You'll find the information on the data I want to collect in the file "DATA_DB.md"

### Important documents (These docs are made to be edited by anyone!)

- [IDEAS.md](https://github.com/EstefanTT/blocktivity/blob/master/TODO_LIST.md)   
- [DATA_DB.md](https://github.com/EstefanTT/blocktivity/blob/master/DATA_DB.md)   

### What can you do ? 

Have a look at the [TODO_LIST.md](https://github.com/EstefanTT/blocktivity/blob/master/TODO_LIST.md) file. Suggest an idea ([IDEAS.md](https://github.com/EstefanTT/blocktivity/blob/master/TODO_LIST.md)) or think about what kind of data would be nice to add into the Bocktivity database ([DATA_DB.md](https://github.com/EstefanTT/blocktivity/blob/master/DATA_DB.md)) for later charts, tables or analysis.
